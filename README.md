### Purpose
To some extent, the purpose of this project is to be a **recipe book** of data structures and other interesting code applications. This, providing clear documentations and detailed step-by-step tests.

### Vision
- To provide **algorithmically optimized structure**s for a whole spectrum of needs: from basic union finders to generic weighted graphs. This, will all kind of design variations in order to adjust to any specific needs.
- To provide **efficient and correct algorithms** for all types of requierements: from basic graph searches to amortized shortest path routes. This, with detailed tests of foreknown solutions to guarantee proper execution and results.

### Envisage
- To keep the structures and solutions *as optimized as possible*.
- To expand and attempt to cover all kinds of algorithmic requirements.
- To remain open to all comments, critiques and contributions.

#### Remarks
This project was started in the summer of 2019. As it is still quite young, not all structures and solutions have been covered or optimized. However, in time, the idea is for the contents to match the vision. It is just a matter of patience.

#### Latest comment
**Janauary of 6 2020**: Currently working on properly developing the variations of undirected unweighted graphs. This includes basic and generic implementations with their respective common algorithms.

###### Language
- **CC**: *Connected Component*. Meant for graphs, it means that the structure keeps track of connected components.
- **AM**: *Adjacency Matrix*. Meant for graphs, it means that the structure uses an adjacency matrix representation.
